We're excited to share a lab update! I am gearing up for the EMBO Workshop, a deep dive into plasmid evolution and its connection to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). <br>**Decoding Antibiotic Resistance Spread**<br>Antimicrobial resistance is a global challenge, with bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. Plasmids, tiny genetic carriers, play a role by shuttling resistance genes between bacteria. <br>**Unveiling Plasmid Secrets**<br> At the EMBO Workshop, we'll be exploring plasmid biology and ecology. Recent tech advancements allow us to better understand how plasmids contribute to AMR outbreaks.<br>**Collaboration for Progress**<br>The workshop is a hub of experts – from modelers to genetics researchers. I am thrilled to be part of this collaborative effort to address AMR challenges.<br>**My Role in the Workshop**<br>I’m eager to learn, contribute, and develop fresh approaches to tackle AMR. Stay tuned as we share insights from this enlightening experience.<br>Learn more about the workshop: [EMBO Plasmid workshop](https://meetings.embo.org/event/23-amr-plasmids)
